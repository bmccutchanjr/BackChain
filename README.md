# BackChain

BackChain is a backward-chaining AI engine written entirely in JavaScript and intended to run on the back end (server side) of a web application.

Backward-chaining AI engines are also known as 'inference engines' or 'expert systems'.  They are analgous to a simple decision tree (although they can get rather involved with hundreds or even thousands of conditions) and are used to make a decision or classify some unknown.

Imagine asking an ornithologist "I saw a bird I didn't recognize.  What was it?".  A backward-chaining AI would answer that question by prompting the same questions an expert would; "Where did you see it?", "What color was it?", "How big was it?".  The goal is to provide the same answer the expert might.

The big advantage of a backward-chaining AI is that it could lead to more than one possible answer and provide level of confidence.  "Well, I'm almost certain you saw a Northern Harrier but it might have been a Red-Tailed Hawk, maybe even a falcon."
